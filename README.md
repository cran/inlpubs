## Description

The [R](https://www.r-project.org/) package **inlpubs** may be used to
search and analyze 366 publications that cover the 74-year history of
the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), Idaho Water Science Center, [Idaho
National Laboratory Project
Office](https://www.usgs.gov/centers/idaho-water-science-center/science/idaho-national-laboratory-project-office)
(INLPO). The INLPO publications were authored by 253 researchers trying
to better understand the effects of waste disposal on water contained in
the eastern Snake River Plain aquifer and the availability of water for
long-term consumptive and industrial use. Information contained within
these publications is crucial to the management and use of the aquifer
by the Idaho National Laboratory (INL) and the State of Idaho. USGS
geohydrologic studies and monitoring, which began in 1949, were done in
cooperation with the U.S. Department of Energy Idaho Operations Office.
