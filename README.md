## Description

The [R](https://www.r-project.org/) package **inlpubs** may be used to
search and analyze the 385 publications that cover the 76-year history
of the U.S. Geological Survey ([USGS](https://www.usgs.gov/)), Idaho
Water Science Center, Idaho National Laboratory Project Office
([INLPO](https://www.usgs.gov/centers/idaho-water-science-center/science/idaho-national-laboratory-project-office)).
The INLPO publications were authored by 263 researchers trying to better
understand the effects of waste disposal on water contained in the
eastern Snake River Plain aquifer and the availability of water for
long-term consumptive and industrial use. Information contained within
these publications is crucial to the management and use of the aquifer
by the Idaho National Laboratory ([INL](https://inl.gov/)) and the State
of Idaho. USGS geohydrologic studies and monitoring, which began in
1920, were done in cooperation with the U.S. Department of Energy Idaho
Operations Office. A word cloud highlighting the 200 most popular words
used in titles and abstracts is shown below.
